# Web-Design-Assignments
Small Repo for my Web Design Class, no need to be private, might help someone.

This is basically my personal notes and some html source code.

So the current version of this site will be available at http://studentweb.comminfo.rutgers.edu/class-2015-1-04-547-320-03/ada80/index.html


instructions for uploading.

download an SFTP client. give it a host of 

===
sftp://studentweb.comminfo.rutgers.edu


===

/www/studentweb.comminfo.rutgers.edu/htdocs/class-2015-1-04-547-320-03/ada80/

===

and lastly give it a username and credentials like you would anything else.

Then find the updated site at http://studentweb.comminfo.rutgers.edu/class-2015-1-04-547-320-03/ada80/
